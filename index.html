        NS 100-ton Hoppers still running on the rails</h4>
      <p> Added additional information for <a href="equipment.html">Existing Equipment</a> 
        page: <br>
        Covered hoppers (Most of these were from a group of 150 cars numbered 
        5300-5449, built in 1973. The last of new cars to be bought by the independent 
        NS.<br>
        Bought for phosphate service on the Lee Creek Branch.<br>
        From ORERs, it shows that the Southern eventually renumbered them into 
        a 90850-90999 pool (supported by NS 5405-&gt;SOU 90920-&gt;PLCX 16688).<br>
        The 1975 ORER lists 105 still lettered for NS, then the numbers dwindle 
        in 1977 - 80, 1979 - 46, 1980 - 26, 1981 - 18, 1983 - 16.<br>
        This last numbering scheme would support PLCX range 16621-16765. By the 
        1989 ORER, it showed PLCX having 145 of these and SOU - zero.</p>

        The first all-steel cabooses built for the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad 
        were produced in 1937 by the Magor Car Corporation in Clifton, N.J. Magor, 
        along with St. Louis Car Company and ACF, ultimately built a total of 
        350 cabooses for the C&amp;O using a similar design. The last were produced 
        in 1949. Through subsequent rebuilding and modernization, many remained 
        in service through the end of regular caboose usage in the 1980s. Cabooses 
        of a similar design were also built for Pere Marquette, Missouri Pacific

        NS 384 added to surviving <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> page</h4>
      <p>Thought you may be interested in hearing about this former NS caboose, 
        No. 384. See the attached photos. The caboose is located on private property, 
        but I was allowed to take some photos back in 2006. As you can see from 
        the photos, it has been made into a cabin with a stick-built addition 
        extending off the left side between the bay and the A-end, and a deck 
        along the rest of that side all the way to the B-end platform. From the 
        placement of the addition, a hole had to be cut in the side of the car 
        near the A-end on the left side. How big the hole is I had no way of determining. 
        The B-end leaf-spring truck had NOR-SOU. RR. cast on the side-frame. I 
        did not check the A-end truck.<br>
        <br>
        The car is south of Cordele out of view on the east side of US41 just 
        north of the GA300 interchange. You may be able to spot it on Google Earth.<br>

        N S Historical Society Annual Meeting</h4>
      <p>We will be meeting at the NC Railway Museum in New Hope (Bonsal, NC) 
        on Saturday May 2, 2009. The agenda will be as follows.</p>
      <p>9:30 to 11:30 AM The railway museum will be open for walking around the 
        various displays and the company store should also be open to accept any 
        funds you want to spend.<br>
        11:30 to 12:15 PM Lunch<br>
        12:15 to 1:30 PM The Business meeting will be on one of the train cars.<br>
        2:00 to 3:30 PM Train ride. The Museum may be able to do a run by.</p>
      <p>Since there are no restaurants close by, we have made arrangements with 
        Old Time Barbecue to cater a lunch. The menu will be Eastern Carolina 
        Pork Barbecue along with hush puppies, potatoes and green beans. Drinks 
        will include Sweet Tea and Lemonade. If you would rather have something 
        else to eat or drink, you will need to bring it with you. A $9.00 donation 
        per person is suggested. The Society will have to pay for any difference 
        in the total bill. At present we have given a number of 60 people to Old 
        Time. Make sure that you send back the enclosed flyer with the total number 
        of people that you intend to bring to lunch. Money will be collected on 
        May 2nd.<br>
        The Society has also had to commit to a cost of $375.00 to the NC Railway 
        Museum for the Train ride. The cost of an adult is $9.00 and children 
        12 years and younger is $6.00. The total seats on the Train are 239 seats. 
        To pre reserve seats please send in your money along with the enclosed 
        form. You will be able to pick up your tickets after 9:30 AM on the 2nd. 
        You can also invite your non member friends to ride the train, as long 
        as someone pays for the ticket. The Train ride will be a first come first 
        serve basis. If we go past 239 then we will have a standby list.<br>
        If you have any questions you can contact me (John Janosko) at 919 656 
        6897. Hope everyone can come and I for one intend on having a great time.<br>

        Save the NS 701!!!<br>
        http://norfolksouthernhs.org/ns701.htm</h4>
      <p>Save a piece of North Carolina history! As railroaders in this state, 
        we all know another Norfolk Southern existed long ago, and now is almost 
        completely gobbled up in the flurry of mergers and abandonments of the 
        last thirty years. Still, an original piece of the old NS remains in locomotive 
        NS 701, currently in storage, but now threatened with the scrapper&#39;s 
        torch! We at the NS Historical Society and the North Carolina Railway 
        Museum feel a tangible piece of history like this should be preserved, 
        and believe you feel the same way. We have therefore established the NS 
        701 Preservation and Restoration Fund. If you are interested in seeing

      <p>These 70-tonners once ran the rails at Bonsal, NC during construction 
        of the relocation of the NS rail line during the building of Jordan Lake, 
        so it would be fitting that we bring one of them back to the New Hope 
        Valley Railway! They were the first NS purchase of locomotive power other 
        than Baldwin since 0-6-0 number 14 back in 1900. Delivered to the NS from 
        GE in June 1948, they were the only 70-tonners used to pull the mail and 
        express trains (#1 &amp; #2) between Raleigh and Norfolk, VA. The last 
        run of the mail train was December 12th, 1951 and after that, these engines 
        were used in local and branch line service and as switchers at the smaller 
        yards. After #702 was sold in 1964, the other two (701 &amp; 703) spent 
        most of their time around New Bern and on the Bayboro Branch. After the 
        1974 merger with Southern Railway, they were repainted again into the 
        Southern black colors and remained on the SR roster until 1978. The Norfolk 
        &amp; Southern was the only Class 1 railroad to have its' Headquarters 
        located in Raleigh, NC.<br>
