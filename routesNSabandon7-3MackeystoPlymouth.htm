      <p>Norfolk Southern Railway Company Abandonment Exemption in Washington 
        County, NC</p>
      <p><br>
        On April 7, 2004, Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR) filed with the 
        Surface Transportation Board (Board) a petition under 49 U.S.C. 10502 
        for exemption from the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10903-10905 to abandon 
        a 7.3-mile line of railroad between milepost NS-82.7 at Mackeys, and milepost 
        NS-90.0 at Plymouth, in Washington County, NC. The line segment traverses 
        United States Postal Service Zip Code 27962, and includes the stations 
        of Mackeys and Plymouth.</p>
      <p>The line does not contain federally granted rights-of-way. Any documentation 
        in NSRs possession will be made available promptly to those requesting 
        it.</p>
      <p>The interest of railroad employees will be protected by the conditions 
        set forth in Oregon Short<br>

      <p>By issuance of this notice, the Board is instituting an exemption proceeding 
        pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10502(b). A final decision will be issued by July 
        26, 2004.</p>
      <p>Unless the request for an exemption from the provisions of section 10904 
        is granted, any offer of financial assistance (OFA) under 49 CFR 1152.27(b)(2) 
        will be due no later than 10 days after service of a decision granting 
        the petition for exemption. Each OFA must be accompanied by a $1,100 filing 
        fee. See 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(25).</p>
      <p>All interested persons should be aware that, following abandonment of 
        rail service and salvage of the line, the line may be suitable for other 
        public use, including interim trail use. Any request<br>
        for a public use condition under 49 CFR 1152.28 or for trail use/rail 
        banking under 49 CFR 1152.29 will be due no later than May 17, 2004. Each 
        trail use request must be accompanied by a filing fee which will be $200 
        as of April 28, 2004. See 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(27), as amended in Regulations 
        Governing Fees for Services Performed in Connection with Licensing and 
        Related Services2002 New Fees, STB Ex Parte No. 542 (Sub-No. 4) (STB served 
        and published Mar. 29, 2004).</p>

        (Sub-No. 248X) and must be sent to: (1) Surface Transportation Board,

        are due on or before May 17, 2004.</p>
      <p>Persons seeking further information concerning abandonment procedures 
        may contact the Boards Office of Public Services at (202) 565-1592 or 
        refer to the full abandonment or discontinuance regulations at 49 CFR

        if necessary), prepared by SEA, will be served upon all parties of record
