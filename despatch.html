      <h2>The Eastern Carolina Despatch Newsletter</h2>
      <p>The Society prints and mails out to its members a bi-annual newsletter, 
        the <i>Eastern Carolina Despatch</i>. Reprints of the following issues 
        are now being made. Each issue will be in the current booklet format, 
        with 20 pages including stiff paper front and back covers with color photos. 
      </p>
      <p>Unlike Volume 1, which we reprinted with both issues in a single booklet, 
        subsequent volumes will consist of two separate booklets for each issue. 
        Each issue will contain society and general railroad news, plus feature 
        articles. For your information, the feature articles contained in each 
        issue are tabulated below:</p>
