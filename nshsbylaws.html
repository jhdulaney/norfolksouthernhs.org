        of business is at 2222 West Club Boulevard, Durham, Durham County, North

        the corporation may require. The official seal adopted by the Board of 
        Directors is kept by the Secretary and shall be affixed to all legal documents 
        or transactions as required.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Section 2 - Purposes and Objectives:</b></p>
      <p>The Society is organized to secure and study the history of, and educate 
        the public about the history of, the original Norfolk (&amp;) Southern

        meaning of Sections 501 (c) (3), and to receive gifts which qualify under 
        Section 170, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the corresponding 
        provisions of any future United States Internal Revenue Code.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Section 3 - Limitations:</b></p>
      <p>The Society shall not carry on any activity prohibited by an organization 
        exempt from federal income tax under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal

        pay reasonable compensation for services rendered and to make payments 
        and distributions in furtherance of the purposes set forth in Article 
        1, Section 2. The avoidance of conflict of interest shall be a guiding 
        principle in all Society endeavors. No substantial part of the activities 
        of the Society shall be the carrying on of propaganda, or otherwise attempting 
        to influence legislation, and the Society shall not participate in, or

        to a like organization operating in the State of North Carolina, as determined 
        by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and shall be used or 
        distributed for no other object or purpose whatsoever; provided, however, 
        that any such organization must be exempt from federal income taxes under 
        Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. Any such 
        assets not so disposed of shall be disposed of by the Superior Court of 
        the county in which the principal office of the corporation is then located, 
        exclusively for such purposes or to such organizations, such as the court 
        shall determine, which are organized and operated exclusively for such 
        purposes.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Article 2<br>
        Board of Directors<br>
        Section 1 - Number and Composition:</b></p>
      <p>The Board of Directors, hereinafter referred to as the Board, shall be 
        composed of seven (7) voting members as follows:</p>
      <p>Seven (7) Directors shall be elected for three-year terms with two, two, 
        and three of the terms expiring on the last day of each fiscal year, respectively. 
        Their successors shall be elected by a majority vote of the voting Directors 
        present and voting at the annual meeting. The founding Board, after adoption 
        of these by-laws, shall draw lots for two, two, and three terms of three, 
        four and five years, respectively, to establish a rotation. A slate of 
        Director candidates shall be chosen by the Nominations Committee of the 
        Board.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Section 2 - Terms of Office:</b></p>
      <p>Each Director shall serve a term of three (3) years. </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Section 3 - Meetings and Procedural Rules:</b></p>
      <p>The annual meeting of the Society shall be the Spring meeting. The Board 
        shall meet at such other times as the presiding officer shall deem necessary. 
        A special meeting may be called at any time by the President of the Board 
        or upon the written request of any three (3) Directors. The nature of 
        the meeting shall be stated in the notice. Robert's Rules of Order governs 
        the conduct of business.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Section 4 - Quorum:</b></p>
      <p>More than 50% of the voting Directors in office shall constitute a quorum.</p>
      <p align="center"> <b><br>
        Section 5 - Informal Action by Directors or Committees:</b></p>
      <p>Action taken by a majority of the Directors or members of a committee 
        without a meeting is nevertheless Board or committee action if written 
        consent to the action in question is signed by all the Directors or members 
        of the committee, as the case may be, and filed with the minutes of the 
        proceedings of the Board or committee, whether done before or after the 
        action so taken. If a meeting of Directors otherwise valid is held without 
        proper call or notice, action taken at such meeting otherwise valid is 
        deemed ratified by a Director who did not attend unless promptly after 
        having knowledge of the action taken and of the impropriety in question 
        he files with the Secretary of the Society his written objection to the 
        holding of the meeting or to any specific action so taken. Any one (1) 
        or more Directors or members of a committee may participate in a meeting 
        of the Board or committee by means of a conference telephone or similar 
        communications device which allows all persons participating in the meeting 
        to hear each other and such participation in a meeting shall be deemed 
        presence in person at such meeting.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Section 6 - Powers and Duties:</b></p>
      <p>The Board of Directors may exercise all power and authority of the Society 
        and carry out such legal acts and duties for the furtherance of the aims 
        of the Society and transaction of its affairs as are not prohibited by 
        statute, this Constitution or by the Certificate of Incorporation. The 
        Board may employ such accountants as it deems advisable for the proper 
        verification of all accounts and require an officer of the Society to 
        carry such bonds as it deems advisable. Each Director shall discharge 
        his duties as a Director, including his duties as a member of a committee, 
        in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position 
        would exercise under similar circumstances, and in a manner the Director 
        reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the corporation. </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Section 7 - Remuneration:</b></p>
      <p>No Directors shall be paid any salary by the Society.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Section 8 - Members: </b></p>
      <p>The Directors shall be the members of the Society, and their meetings 
        shall constitute meetings of the members of the Society.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Section 9 - Director's Conflict of Interest:</b></p>
      <p>Any corporate transaction in which a Director has a direct or indirect 
        interest must be authorized, approved, or ratified in good faith by a 
        majority, not less than two (2), of the Directors who have no direct or 
        indirect interest in the transaction even though less than a quorum; provided, 
        however, no such transaction shall be authorized, approved, or ratified 
        by a single Director. For purposes of this Section, a Director has an 
        indirect interest in a transaction if:<br>
        <br>
        (a) Another entity in which he has a material financial interest or in 
        which he is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or</p>
      <p>(b) Another entity of which he is a director, officer, or trustee is 
        a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered 
        by the Board.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Section 10 - Certain Director Liability:</b></p>
      <p>In addition to other liabilities imposed by law upon directors, a Director 
        shall be subject to the following liabilities:</p>
      <p>(a) All Directors who vote for or assent to any distribution of assets 
        of the corporation contrary to any lawful restrictions in the North Carolina 
        Nonprofit Corporation Act (the &quot;Act&quot;), the Articles of Incorporation, 
        or these by-laws, shall be jointly and severally liable to the corporation 
        for the amount of the distribution that exceeds what could have been distributed 
        without violating such restrictions.</p>
      <p>(b) All Directors who vote for or assent to the making of any loan or 
        guaranty or other form of security by the corporation to or for the benefit 
        of the Directors or officers of the corporation, or any of them, except 
        loans, guaranties or other forms of security made to full-time employees 
        of the corporation who are also Directors or officers of the corporation 
        and which were made in accordance with Section 6 of this Article, and 
        this Section, shall be jointly and severally liable to the corporation 
        for the repayment or return of the money or value loaned, with interest 
        thereon at the legal rate until paid, or for any liability of the corporation 
        upon the guarantee.</p>
      <p>(c) A Director shall not be liable under the provisions of subparagraphs 
        (a) and (b), above, if he performed his duties in compliance with Section 
        6 of this Article or (unless his actual knowledge concerning the matter 
        in question makes such reliance unreasonable) he relied on information, 
        opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other 
        financial data, if prepared or presented by (1) one or more officers or 
        employees of the corporation whom the Director reasonably believes to 
        be reliable and competent in the matters presented; (2) legal counsel, 
        public accountants, or other persons as to matters the Director reasonably 
        believe are within their professional or expert competence; or (3) a committee 
        of the Board of which he is not a member if the Director reasonably believes 
        the committee merits confidence.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Section 11 - Officer, Director, Employee, and Agent 
        Indemnification:</b></p>
      <p> <br>
        (a) Each person who was or is a party to or is involved in any action, 
        suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative 
        and whether formal or informal (hereinafter, a &quot;proceeding&quot; 
        and including without limitation, a proceeding brought by or on behalf 
        of the corporation itself), by reason that he is or was a Director, officer, 
        employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request 
        of the corporation as a Director, officer, partner, trustee, employee 
        or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint 
        venture, trust or other enterprise, or as a trustee or administrator under 
        an employee benefit plan, where the basis of such proceeding is alleged 
        action in an official capacity as Director, officer, employee or agent 
        or in any other capacity while serving as Director, officer, partner, 
        employee, agent, trustee or administrator, shall be indemnified and held 
        harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the North 
        Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act of 1994 (the &quot;Act&quot;) as the 
        same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such 
        amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation 
        to provide broader indemnification rights than the Act permitted the corporation 
        to provide prior to such amendment) against all expense, liability and 
        loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties 
        and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered 
        by such person in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall 
        continue as to a person who has ceased to serve in the capacity that initially 
        entitled such person to indemnification hereunder and shall inure to the 
        benefit of his heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, 
        that the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification 
        in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person 
        only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.</p>
      <p>(b) The right to indemnification conferred in this subparagraph (a) above 
        shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the 
        corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in 
        advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the Act 
        so requires, the payment of expenses incurred by a Director, officer, 
        employee or agent in his capacity as such (and not in any other capacity 
        in which service was or is rendered by such person while a Director, officer, 
        employee, or agent including, without limitation, service to an employee 
        benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall 
        be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking, by or 
        on behalf of such person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall 
        ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified 
        under this Section or otherwise.</p>
      <p> <br>
        (c) If a claim under subparagraphs (a) and (b) above hereof is not paid 
        in full by the corporation within ninety (90) days after a written claim 
        has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter 
        bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the 
        claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled 
        to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense 
        to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for 
        expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final 
        disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been 
        tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards 
        of conduct which make it permissible under the Act for the corporation 
        to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving 
        such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation 
        (including its Board or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination 
        prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant 
        is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard 
        of conduct, set forth in the Act, nor an actual determination by the corporation 
        (including its Board or independent legal counsel) that the claimant has 
        not met the applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the 
        action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable 
        standard of conduct. </p>
      <p>(d) The right to indemnification and the advancement and payment of expenses 
        conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which 
        any person may have or hereafter acquire under any law (common or statutory), 
        the Articles of Incorporation, these bylaws, any agreement, the vote of 
        disinterested Directors, or otherwise.</p>
      <p>(e) The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect 
        itself and any person who is or was serving as a Director, officer, employer 
        or agent of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the 
        corporation as a Director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent 
        of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, 
        trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against any liability 
        asserted against and incurred by that person in any such capacity, or 
        arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would 
        have the power to indemnify that person against such liability under the 
        Act. </p>
      <p>(f) If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any 
        ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall 
        nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each Director, officer, employee 
        and agent of the corporation, as to costs, charges and expenses (including 
        attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement with 
        respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative 
        or investigative to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion 
        of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent 
        permitted by applicable law.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Section 12 - Removal of Directors:</b></p>
      <p>Any Director, whether or not an officer, may be removed from the Board 
        of Directors, including removal from any office held, by the affirmative 
        vote of two-thirds of the Directors at any regular or special meeting 
        called for that purpose, for conduct detrimental to the interests of the 
        corporation, for lack of sympathy with its objectives, or for refusal 
        to render reasonable assistance in carrying out its purposes. Any such 
        Director proposed to be removed shall be entitled to at least five (5) 
        days' notice in writing by registered mail of the meeting at which such 
        removal is to be voted upon and shall be entitled to appear before and 
        be heard at such meeting.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Article 3<br>

        Section 1 - Title of Officers:</b></p>
      <p>The officers of the Board shall consist of a President, a Vice President,

        office until a successor is appointed or elected. Other officers will 
        be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Board.</p>

        powers and duties incident to such office. The President shall conduct 
        and have charge of the affairs of the Society subject to approval of a 
        majority of the Board; and shall submit, with the annual report, recommendations 
        of the conduct of the affairs of the Society for the following year. In
