      <h2>Norfolk & Southern Historical Society, Incorporated</h2>
      <p align="left"> The Norfolk &amp; Southern Historical Society was organized 
          on April 20th, 2002, and incorporated under the laws of the State of 
          North Carolina. A seven-member Board of Directors, which includes the 
          following four officers, governs the organization: (1) President, (2) 
          Vice-President, (3) Secretary, and (4) Treasurer. Members of the Board 
          of Directors serve for terms of three years each, elected in a rotating 
          schedule so that no more than three members' terms expire in any year.</p>
        <p align="left">The Society is organized to secure and study the history 
          of, and educate the public about the history of the original Norfolk 
          (&amp;) Southern Railroad/Railway as a charitable and educational organization, 
          within the meaning of Sections 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code 
          of 1986, and to receive gifts which qualify under section 170 of that 
          code, or the corresponding provisions of any future United States Internal 
          Revenue Code. The principal office and place of business is at 2222 
          West Club Boulevard, Durham, Durham County, North Carolina.</p>
        <p align="left"> It is important to note that the railroad which the organization 
          studies is NOT the current Norfolk Southern Railway, but only a small 
          portion of that railway, specifically that portion which was chartered 
          in the state of North Carolina as the Elizabeth City and Norfolk Railroad 
          in January 1870, was renamed the Norfolk Southern Railroad in January 
          1883, was renamed the Norfolk and Southern Railroad in 1891, was subsequently 
          reorganized and expanded several times, and was merged into the Southern 
          Railway System on January 1st, 1974.</p>
        <p align="left">The Society holds an annual meeting, usually the third 
          Saturday in April, at a location, which is selected by the Board of 
          Directors at the previous year's annual meeting.</p>
