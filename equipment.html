        <p>-- <a href="images/NS387caboose.jpg">Norfolk Southern 387, bay window 
          caboose, in roundhouse</a> This caboose was built from an old boxcar 
          by the NS Railway in their shops in 1937. Some railroads converted their 
          old thirty-six foot boxcars into cabooses for use by the train crew. 
          The sides were stripped to the frame, and in this case new sides and 
          bay windows were fashioned so the crew could watch over the train while 
          in route. Large windows allow easy visibility when going through curves. 
          These cabooses were painted either a boxcar red or gray, depending on 
          the decade. The caboose was donated to the Town of Spencer in 1976 and 
          later to the State of North Carolina in 1986. It has been restored in 
          the last paint scheme of gray with red stripes to match the NS diesel 
          1616 and is displayed in the Robert Julian Roundhouse.<br>
          -- <a href="images/NS911-workcar.jpg">Norfolk Southern 911, maintenance-of-way 
          camp car, stored outside adjacent to roundhouse.</a> This car was built 
          in 1943 by the Pullman Company as a US Army troop sleeper. Norfolk Southern 
          purchased the car after World War II and used it in maintenance-of-way 
          service for work crews. Norfolk Southern Corporation donated the car 
          to the State of North Carolina in 1979 and is occasionally used by volunteers 
          working over the weekend. (Stored on the property, not on display).<br>
          -- <a href="images/NS1616-NCTM-outside.jpg">Norfolk Southern 1616, diesel 
          locomotive, in roundhouse</a> This non-operating locomotive was built 
          by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1955. The AS-416 is one of several 
          that were ordered by the original Norfolk Southern Railway. The 1616 
          has electrical components supplied by General Electric. The original 
          NS ran from Charlotte, NC through Raleigh to Norfolk, VA. Early dieselization 
          used Baldwins and General Electric 70-tonners. Later they bought EMD 
          GP-18s. The Southern Railway merged the NS Railway into the system in 
          1974, and after the N&amp;W merger in 1982, used the name in part for 
          the new corporation. After 1974, Southern sold all the remaining Baldwin 
          locomotives, and the 1616 went to the Peabody Coal Company in Lentzburg, 
          Ill. They donated the engine to the State of North Carolina in 1981, 
          and volunteers restored the locomotive to its late 1950s early 1960s 
          appearance. It is now on display in the Robert Julian Roundhouse.<br>
