      <h3 align="center">Brief History of the First Norfolk Southern Railroad<br>
      </h3>
      <div align="center">By Robert C. Reisweber, February 23rd, 2005</div>
      <p>What would eventually become the first Norfolk Southern Railroad was 
        chartered on January 20th, 1870 in North Carolina as the Elizabeth City 
        and Norfolk Railroad. It was intended to run between its namesake cities, 
        a distance of 46 miles. Construction did not begin until 1880. The track 
        was completed on May 12th, 1881, and the first train from Norfolk to Elizabeth 
        City ran on May 26th, 1881. The line was extended 27 miles southward to 
        Edenton, NC in December 1881. The first train to Edenton ran on December 
        13th of that year.</p>
      <p>Owners of the EC&amp;N soon formed plans to extend the line southward. 
        They changed the name of the company to Norfolk Southern Railroad Company 
        on February 1st, 1883 to indicate this. The company entered receivership 
        in 1889 and emerged as the Norfolk and Southern Railroad Company in 1891. 
        At the same time, the Ablemarle and Pantego Railroad became part of the 
        new company. That railroad ran from Mackey's Ferry, NC (now known as Mackeys) 
        through Pantego to Belhaven, NC. It also operated a ferry service from 
        Mackey's Ferry across Albemarle Sound to Edenton, where it connected with 
        the N&amp;S.</p>
      <p>In January 1900, the N&amp;S expanded again by absorbing the Norfolk, 
        Virginia Beach and Southern Railroad. That company operated a line from 
        downtown Norfolk to the Virginia Beach oceanfront, where it owned and 
        operated the Princess Anne Hotel. In 1904, the N&amp;S took over the Chesapeake 
        Transit Company, which had opened a competing line from Norfolk to Virginia 
        Beach via Cape Henry in 1902.</p>
      <p> In March 1904, the N&amp;S purchased the Washington and Plymouth Railroad, 
        which ran between those North Carolina cities. The N&amp;S extended this 
        line from Plymouth to Mackey's Ferry to create a main line 135 miles long, 
        but which required a nine-mile ferry trip from Edenton to Mackey's Ferry.</p>
      <p>The N&amp;S expanded southward again on November 23rd, 1906, when it 
        merged with four other railroads. By building connections between these 
        lines, a system was created which ran from Norfolk to Raleigh, NC, with 
        branches to New Bern, Beaufort, Morehead City, Kinston, Goldsboro, Columbia, 
        Oriental, and Belhaven, NC, and Virginia Beach and Suffolk, VA.</p>
      <p> This system was still hampered by the slow ferry across Albemarle Sound. 
        The company immediately began to remedy this by beginning construction 
        of a five-mile-long timber trestle across the sound. While this was under 
        construction, the company again went into receivership in 1908, emerging 
        as a new Norfolk Southern Railroad Company on May 4th, 1910. Work on the 
        new trestle had continued during the receivership, however, and the first 
        train across it ran on January 1st, 1910.</p>
      <p> In 1911, the NS purchased the charter of the Raleigh, Charlotte and 
        Southern Railroad Company, which had been formed to build a railroad from 
        Raleigh to Charlotte, NC. Once again, the NS found it expedient to buy 
        four existing railroads and connect them together to accomplish this objective. 
        These railroads also possessed trackage to the cities of Fayetteville, 
        Aberdeen, Asheboro, Ellerbe, Carthage, and Jackson Springs. These lines 
        became branches of the new NS. In May 1920, the NS leased the Durham and 
        South Carolina Railroad, which became its Durham branch. At this point, 
        the total milage of track operated by the Norfolk Southern reached 942 
        miles, its greatest extent.</p>
      <p>Several branches were abandoned in subsequent years, including those 
        to Suffolk, Columbia, Oriental, Asheboro, Ellerbe, Carthage, and Jackson 
        Springs. Also abandoned was lease of trackage to Beaufort, Morehead City, 
        Kinston, and Goldsboro. On January 1st, 1974, the Norfolk Southern was 
        merged into the Southern Railway System. At that time, just over 600 miles 
        of NS track remained in service.</p>
