              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span style="">The 
                open-deck trestle originally consisted of 2,131 untreated cypress 
                and pine full-pile bents and was completed in 1910. It is 5.05 
                miles In length. Each bent consisted of four batter piles and 
                to plumb piles having a diameter at the water line of from 12 
                inches to 14 inches, a 12-inch by 12-inch cap, two 3-inch by 10-inch 
                diagonal sway braces, and two 3-inch by 12-inch horizontal sash 
                braces. The batter of the outside batter piles was 3:12 and of 
                the inner batter piles 1-1/2:12. The cap was secured to the top 
                of each pile by a 3/4-inch drift bolt. At the cap, the center-lines 
                of the piles were located, respectively, 1-1/2 feet, 3-1/2 feet, 
                and 5-1/2 feet from the vertical center-line of the bent. The 
                top ends and the bottom ends of the diagonal sway braces were 
                secured to the ends of the cap and outside batter piles, respectively, 
                by 3/4-inch bolts. These braces were secured to the other piles 
                by 1/2-inch by 8-inch spikes. The bottom ends of these braces 
                were located approximately at the low-tide water level. The sash 
                braces were located beneath the sway braces and were secured to 
                each pile by a 3/4-inch bolt.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span style="">The 
                bents were 12 feet 6 inches apart and were connected by four 8-inch 
                by 16-inch by 25-foot untreated fir stringers located on the tops 
                of the caps. Two stringers were located on each side of the vertical 
                center-line of the bent at right angles to the cap and with the 
                16-inch dimension in a vertical position. The two stringers were 
                secured together by 3/4-inch bolts with spacers between and were 
                secured to the cap of each bent by a 3/4-inch drift bolt extending 
                vertically through the outside stringer. The joints of the stringers 
                were staggered and were located at the caps. The inside faces 
                of the inside stringers were located 1 foot 9-3/4 inches from 
                the vertical center-lines of the bents. The 7-inch by 8-inch by 
                9-foot untreated white oak ties were placed on the stringers at 
                a distance of 14 inches between center-lines. They were secured 
                to the inside stringers by 1/2-inch by 12-inch spikes. The rails 
                were single-spiked. No tie plates were provided. The tops of the 
                rails were approximately 15-1/2 feet above the low-tide water 
                level. Diagonal braces extending between bents in alternate bays 
                were provided. These braces had a section of 3 inches by 12 inches 
                and were secured by 3/4-inch drift bolts to the outside batter 
                piles at the top ends and at the water level. A 3/4-inch bolt 
                secured the braces on each side at the center. Untreated cypress 
                and fir guard rails were provided and were secured to the ends 
                of the ties by 5/8-inch spikes.</span></p>

                the period extending from 1910 through 1949, inclusive, 8 bents 
                were replaced with full-pile treated pine bents, and the plies 
                of 2,093 bents were cut off approximately at the low-tide water 
                level and untreated wood frames were applied. Each frame consists 
                of a 12-inch by 12-inch base sill, two 12-inch by 12-inch batter 
                posts having a batter of 3:12, two 12-inch by 12-inch plumb posts, 
                a 12-inch by 12-inch cap, and two 3-inch by 10-inch diagonal sway 
                braces. The sill is secured to each pile by a 3/4-inch drift bolt. 
                Each post is secured to the sill by two 3/4-inch drift bolt. At 
                the cap, the centers of the batter posts and the plump posts are, 
                respectively, 4 feet 6 inches and 2 feet 6 inches from the vertical 
                center-line of the bent. The tope ends and the bottom ends of 
                the diagonal sway braces are secured to the ends of the cap and 
                the ends of the sill, respectively, by 3/4-inch bolts. These braces 
                are secured to the plump posts by 1/2-inch by 8-inch spikes. Diagonal 
                braces extending between the frame-type bents are provided. These 
                braces have a section of 3 inches by 10 Inches and are secured 
                by 3/4-inch bolts to the batter posts at the top and bottom ends. 
                A 3/4-inch bolt secures the braces on each side at the center. 
                Two horizontal 4-inch by 12-Inch sash braces are provided at the 
                top ends of the piles of a bent and two horizontal diagonal braces 
                are provided between the sills of adjacent bents where considered 
                necessary. No sway braces are provided between the water level 
                and the mud line. On bents that have been reworked since 1955, 
                the centers of the batter posts and the plumb posts are, respectively, 
                4 feet and 2 feet from the vertical center-line of the bent, and 
                the sway braces are secured to the plumb posts by 3/4-inch bolts.</span></p>

                the period extending between 1919 and 1923, inclusive, a third 
                stringer was applied on each side of the trestle. The three stringers 
                are secured together by eight 3/4-inch bolts with spacers between, 
                and are secured to the cap of each bent by a 3/4-inch drift bolt 
                extending vertically through the middle stringer. The joints of 
                the stringers are staggered and are located at the caps. The center-lines

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span style="">During 
                1949, a program of replacing bents with full-pile treated pine 
                bents and wood stringers with fabricated steel stringers was initiated. 
                Each of these bents consists of four batter piles and two plumb 
                piles, a 12-inch by 12-inch cap, two 3-inch by 10-inch diagonal 
                sway braces, and two 3-inch by 10-inch horizontal sash braces. 
                All members of the bent are treated pine. The plies comply with 
                the American Railway Engineering Association specifications for 
                wood piles. The batter of the outside batter piles is 3:12 and 
                of the inner batter plies 1-1/2:12. The cap is secured to the 
                top of each pile by a 3/4-inch drift bolt. At the cap, the centerlines 
                of the piles are located, respectively, 1 foot 1-1/2 Inches, 3 
                feet 3-1/2 inches, and 5 feet 6-1/2 inches from the vertical center-line 
                of the bent. The diagonal sway braces are secured by 3/4-inch 
                bolts to the ends of the caps and outside batter piles at the 
                top ends and to the outside batter piles at the bottom ends. These 
                braces are secured to the other plies by 3/4-inch bolts. The bottom 
                ends of these braces are located approximately at the low-tide 
                water level. The sash braces are located beneath the sway braces 
                and are secured to each pile by a 3/4 -inch bolt. The fabricated 
                steel stringers consist of two 16-inch by 7-inch WF 1-beam sections 
                25 feet in length weighing 45 pounds per foot. The 16-inch dimension 
                is placed vertically. The sections are spaced 15 inches apart 
                by 15-inch channels 8 inches in length bolted to the webs of the 
                section. A steel plate 1/2 inch by 18 Inches is provided at each 
                cap location. A 3-inch by 3-inch angle 22-1/2 inches In length 
                is located on each side of the cap and secures the stringer from 
                longitudinal movement. The plate and angles are bolted to the 
                bottom flanges of the sections. A 7/8-inch lag screw secures the 
                plate to the cap. Where steel stringers are applied, 8-inch by 
                8-inch by 9-foot treated ties are provided. Clip anchors securing 
                ties to the flanges of the sections are provided at every fourth

                diesel-electric unit. They said that no brake application was 
                made immediately before the accident occurred. They estimated

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span style="">Examination 
                of the equipment after the accident occurred disclosed no defects 
                which could have caused or contributed to the cause of the accident. 
                Examination of the control equipment of the first diesel-electric 
                unit disclosed that the isolation switch was in off position, 
                the throttle was in closed position, the automatic brake valve 
                was in emergency position, and the independent brake valve was 
                in full application position, indicating that the engineer took 
                action to stop the train at the time the accident occurred. The 
                tapes of the speed-recording devices of both diesel-electric units 
                were water-soaked and, as a result, were damaged to the extent 
                that the recorded speed of the train immediately before the accident 
                occurred could not be determined.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span style="">In 
                the vicinity of the point of accident the trestle consisted of 
                frame-type bents. The penetration of the plies was approximately 
                40 feet. At low tide the depth of the water is about 20 feet. 
                The water level varies approximately 2 feet. There was no indication 
                that equipment had been derailed before the trestle *** The frames 
                of 11 bents were destroyed when the accident occurred. Twenty-one 
                piles of these bents remained in place. Since only about 20 percent 
                of the trestle members involved In the accident were recovered, 
                the sequence of events that led to the failure of the trestle 
                could not definitely be determined. There was no indication of 
                damage to the plies by marine borers. One batter post of a frame 
                involved in the accident was decayed near the bottom end to the 
                extent that only approximately 30 percent of the original cross-sectional 
                area was effective in bearing the load applied to the post. (See 
                Plate 1.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span style=""></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span style="">Examination 
                of the remaining portion of the trestle from the deck after the 
                accident occurred disclosed that a large number of ties were in 
                various states of decay. None of the decayed ties were adjacent 
                to each other. A number of stringers were decayed but not more 
                than one decayed stringer was found in any group of three stringers 
                on either side of the trestle. Examination from the water level 
                disclosed that a number of piles-of the bents containing the original 
                full piles were in various states of decay. The outside batter 
                pile of one of these bents had spilt longitudinally and had decayed 
                near the water line to the extant that it had failed. Two other 
                piles In this bent were considerably decayed. (See Plate 2 and 
                3.) The tops of the plies supporting the frames of a considerable 
                number of frame-type bents had deteriorated" to the extent that 
                the sills were not bearing on them. Some of these bends had as 
                many as three piles in that condition with results that the sill 
                was subjected to high bending stresses and three piles were bearing 
                a load which should have been distributed over six piles. A considerable 
                number of frame-type bents were found in which the sill was not 
                bearing on the outside batter pile. In some cases the pile was 
                missing or had moved from its proper location, and in other cases 
                the pile was in its proper location but the top of the pile had 
                deteriorated to the extent that it was not in contact with the 
                sill. (See Plates 4 and 5.) Under that condition the unsupported 
                end of the sill was required to withstand the force transmitted 
                by the batter post and high bending stresses were produced in 
                the sill where it was supported by the inside better post. Two 
                bents were found in which the sills had failed because the top 
                of the outside batter pile was not in contact with the sill. (See 
                Plates 6 and 7.) In each case the outside batter pile was in its 
                proper location and prevented the sill from breaking off completely. 
                It is probably in each of these cases that if the outside batter 
                pile had moved from ts proper location or had been missing the 
                bend would have failed.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span style="">The 
                trestle is maintained by two regularly assigned bridge crews. 
                Each crew inspects a portion of the trestle each working day. 
                Bridge patrolmen inspect the trestle from a velocipede car after 
                each train movement. Weekly inspection are made from the deck 
                by a bridge supervisor who is frequently accompanied by an assistant 
                chief engineer. These inspections are made by riding trains and 
                track motor-cars, and by walking on the deck of the trestle. Inspections 
                from the water level are made by boat. The last inspection made 
                from the deck before the accident occurred was on July 3, 1957. 
                No inspection had been made by boat since January 1957.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12pt;"><span style="">During 
                the period extending between 1949 and 1956, inclusive, 274 original 
                full-pile and frame-type bents were replaced with full-pile treated 
                pine bents, and steel stringers having a total length of approximately 
                5,800 feet were applied. At the time of the accident the carrier's 
                replacement program for 1957 indicated that 93 bents were to be 
                replaced and that steel stringers having a total length of 400 
                feet were to be applied during that year. If the 1957 rate of 
                replacement of bents is maintained in the future, it would require 
                19 years for the replacement of all original full-pile and frame-type 
                bents.</span></p>
